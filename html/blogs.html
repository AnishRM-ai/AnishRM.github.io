        <p>It’s been an emotional roller coaster with a steep learning curve. As someone who has always been fascinated by technology and how things work, I was ecstatic to begin my journey in computer science. The first few weeks of classes were exhausting, with new concepts and theories being thrown at me from every direction. I was inundated with new jargon and had to work hard to keep up. But, as the weeks passed, I found myself becoming increasingly interested in what I was learning. The rush of writing code for the first time and seeing it work was unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Since it’s almost the end of the first semester, I want to share a few things. Before beginning university, I had a basic understanding of programming concepts and some coding experience. However, the last few months have allowed me to broaden my knowledge and take my programming skills to new heights. The lectures and labs have been designed in such a way that students can gradually understand the concepts and apply what they have learned in a practical setting. I can now write code in multiple programming languages and am confident in my ability to create programs from the ground up. This is a huge accomplishment for me, and I am grateful for the opportunities provided by the university to help me grow as a programmer. Despite the difficulties, I am pleased to report that my studies are proceeding smoothly. I’ve been working hard to keep up with the workload and make the best use of the resources at my disposal. I’ve consistently received high marks on my assignments and exams, which has boosted my confidence and motivated me to keep working hard. I am grateful for the assistance of my professors and peers in navigating the complexities of computer science. They encouraged me to ask questions and gave me invaluable advice when I needed it most. I want to push myself further and improve my programming skills even more.</p>
        <p>In summary, my first semester studying computer science has been an adventure full of struggles and successes. I am appreciative of the chances I have had to study, advance, and sharpen my skills. As I anticipate the upcoming semester, I am eager to carry on my adventure and increase my knowledge in this area. I am certain that I have the motivation, tenacity, and support network to enable me to accomplish my goals. I’m excited to follow this route and see where it leads me because the future is promising.</p>

        <p>We all know that we live in a modern society where we all depend on technology, social networks, etc. In the present world, every person has mobile phones in their hands. In the previous week, we had a guest lecturer from the Cyber Security field and we were introduced to what cyber security is and its importance in our normal life as well as in our professional life. In this blog, I am going to explain cyber security, the types of hackers, and the importance of cyber security.

            Cyber Security means protecting or securing digital information from intruders, hackers, and also from malware. There are various types of cyber security such as network security, information security, operational security, etc. It simply means securing your data and networks to prevent intruders and hackers from getting attacked. Prevent data loss so that you can be safe from hackers and protect your personal life.</p>
        <p>Since this blog is about cyber security, let’s talk about hackers. Generally, there are three types of hackers that are white hat hackers, grey hat hackers, and black hat hackers. White hackers usually are called ethical hackers, they don’t do illegal attacks while black hat hackers targets and attacks various organization for their goods. Grey hat hackers usually do both attacking and protecting and finding vulnerabilities to protect data and information. Most black hat hackers usually target large companies to interfere with or steal their information for blackmailing purposes to gain money from them. Some hackers also attack for receiving bounties such as bug bounties.</p>
        <p>Cyber Security plays an essential role in the digital world as we depend on modern electronics and the internet. Overall, we got to know about how important is cyber security in our daily lives as well as in our professional lives and also for various large companies worth million billions of dollars. Many billion dollars company like yahoo, google, meta has also been attacked by hackers making them lose millions of dollars which put users in danger as well. So, cyber security shouldn’t be taken lightly as it can bring harm in a many ways.</p>

        <p>Exams are pretty stressful for most students like us and not only me but also other every level of student gets stressed when the exams are coming close also during the exams. Exams are usually taken to test how much students have learned to date and what they have understood in the modules which were taught. It is taken to test the capabilities of students. Many students have different ways of preparing for exams, so in this blog, I am going to share my strategies for preparing for exams and will also briefly me about my actual exam experience.</p>
        <p>As we all know that without having certain strategies for exam preparation we cannot succeed or attain passing marks in exams. Well, there are many strategies for preparing for exams and all students have different approaches to it. The strategies that I made for preparing exams for are especially by creating a suitable timetable. We should be creating a certain schedule for revision time and it should not be unrealistic, it should be realistic of what you can do. Notes taken in the lecture should be carefully managed and each note should be revised properly. Taking breaks at each interval of time is also very important because, without a proper break, our mind cannot take it much which makes it hard to focus on it. And one of the most important things is the proper amount of sleep, proved by many health experts and scientists proper amount of sleep heals our mind and body and makes it more productive to perform various tasks. It makes us more productive since sleep recovers all our energies as well as heals us internally keeping us active. Practicing past questions from assignments also helps to recall most of the past topics. Doing something physical like exercise and yoga also increases the focus. These are the strategies for preparation of exams although there are still other various strategies for it.</p>
        <p>So, to summarize the exam preparation strategies involve revising, a proper timetable, exercise, a proper amount of sleep, a break between preparation, etc. Preparing for exams can be quite stressful but with the proper amount of rest, revision, dedication, and time management, students can score above-average marks in the exams. My first exams this semester went quite average and learned a lesson on not to be careless the next time. So, one can prepare for exams with these strategies or they can make their own suitable and realistic strategies to ace their exams.</p>
